<h2>About</h2>
<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in The Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves
    also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the Mountain King, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best known for his deeds
            as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.</p>

        <p class="lead">Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who were most often
            named only in "group" references to the entire company.</p>

        <h3 class="featurette-heading">Bilbo Baggins</h3>
        <p>Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and Company to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later
            fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo
            adopted Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River. Bilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and was one of the few to visit the The Undying
            Lands across the ocean.</p>

        <h3 class="featurette-heading">Dwalin</h3>
        <p>Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield
            to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin. Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron.
            In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.</p>

        <h3 class="featurette-heading">Balin</h3>
        <p>Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness
            to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and advisors. Balin was distantly related to Thorin, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin. He later went to re-establish the greatest kingdom of the Dwarves, Khazad-dûm, but within
            five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.</p>

        <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin
            and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
            the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>

        <p>In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin
            and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever
            the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the battle, he settled back into the Lonely Mountain.</p>

        <p>Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.</p>

        <p>Bofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Rhudaur, but was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.</p>
